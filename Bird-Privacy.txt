Bird/Maricom Privacy Policy:
Bird will not collect any personal data.

Other data collection includes:
User IDs, Channel IDs, and Server IDs. These are used in various places in the bot in order to store data relating to your user profile and server configs. Discord IDs (aka snowflakes) are not personally identifiable, other than User IDs linking to your discord account. User IDs can only be used to get Profile Data, such as PFP and Banner. These will most likely NEVER be checked. The other thing snowfakes can do is get the timestamp of account/server/channel creation.
Bird scans all messages when sent (on message function), most of the time, the bot does nothing to them. This is simply how discord works. If they contain "bird", bird will add a reaction, and may add a bird to your inventory, associated with your discord ID. Nothing else comes of this.

I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY POSSIBLE DAMAGES, USE THE BOT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
